I find this terminology used only in Isaiah 28:10, 13:

> precept upon precept, precept upon precept,
    line upon line, line upon line,
    here a little, there a little



Verse 10 in the KJV makes it sound to me like such terminology is describing the **right way** to read God's word (**bolding** in scripture is always my doing):

> 8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.
10 For precept **must be** upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:
11 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.
12 to whom he has said, “This is rest; give rest to the weary; and this is repose”; yet they would not hear.

This is the interpretation that I keep hearing from those who primarily use the KJV.

Here is verse 13 in the KJV — this seems to confuse matters:

> 13 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

This seems to me to say that the terminology in question is describing a **bad way** in which the word of the LORD was interpreted by the Ephraimites (as it resulted in their downfall).

Where these verses say "precept upon precept," the Hebrew is

precept: צַ֣ו (ṣaw)
upon precept:	לָצָ֞ו (lā-ṣāw)

The root here is the same (ṣaw). The only other place this occurs in the Bible is in Hosea 5:11:

> 11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after **the commandment**.

Here the Hebrew "ṣaw" is translated "the commandment." In this context we see that it was not right for Ephraim to walk after the commandment. Because these are the only occurrences of any form of the word, the meaning of this word seems to be something along the lines of how the NASB translates it in Hosea 5:11:

> 11 Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment,
Because he was determined to follow ***man’s* command**.

If the translation of "precept" were replaced with "man's command," Isaiah 28:13 seems to make more sense:

> 13 But the word of the LORD was unto them man's command upon man's command, man's command upon man's command; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

But wait, wouldn't this contradict verse 10? It intially seems to, but notice how the words "must be" in verse 10 of the KJV are italicized. This means that they are not in the original language, but were thought to be implied by the translators. However, if these words are removed, there is no contradiction:

> 10 For precept *must be* upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

In fact, I don't see any other translations that have added something like the KJV's "must be". For example, this is the NASB again:

> 10 “For *He says*,
‘Order on order, order on order,
Line on line, line on line,
A little here, a little there.’”
